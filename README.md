# 📜 Smart Contracts

This repository showcases my journey in deploying and interacting with token contracts on **Sepolia**. I wrote the original contracts in Solidity using Remix IDE, then compiled and converted them into Go bindings using `solc` and `abigen`. Below, you'll find the details of the deployed contracts, categorized and linked for easy reference.

## 🔹 ERC-20 Tokens  
### [ImpireZas (IZ)](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/token/0x8a3ed52ab81eebdb99a3205a52e5fbf692cb416e)  
A standard ERC-20 token deployed on the Sepolia testnet.

## 🔸 ERC-721 (NFT) Contracts  
### [MeowjestyNFT (MJ)](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/token/0x2163138fad4ad344269fb373359ac43e32967a42)  
A non-fungible token contract deployed on the Sepolia testnet.

## 🔺 ERC-1155 (Multi-Token) Contracts  
### [VariantVerse (VVT)](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/token/0x759d5e77ea5ae00614c93fa531e5b22797aef8fd)  
A versatile multi-token contract deployed on the Sepolia testnet.

## ✨ Workflow

1. **Contract Development**  
   - Created contracts in Solidity using Remix IDE.

2. **Compilation and ABI Generation**  
   - Compiled the `.sol` files with `solc`.  
   - Generated Go bindings for each contract using `abigen`.

3. **Integration**  
   - Integrated the generated Go bindings into my Go project for further interaction.

## 🌟 How to Use These Contracts  

- **View on Etherscan**: Click the links above to explore the details of each token.  
- **Interact Programmatically**: Use the Go bindings to interact with the contracts programmatically.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies  

- **Solidity**: Smart contract development.  
- **Remix IDE**: For writing and testing contracts.  
- **solc**: For compiling Solidity contracts.  
- **abigen**: For generating Go bindings from the contract ABI.

## 🚀 Future Plans  
I plan to deploy more contracts across different networks and document the process here. Stay tuned for updates!
